## Plugin Installation

These sections describe how to install, upgrade and uninstall the plugin.

### Install & Upgrade

* Obtain the plugin binary jar file
	* Either download from Bintray (see [Related Links](#related-links)) 
	* Or by building yourself (see [Developers](#developers))

	* Click the `DISABLE` button
	* Click the `REMOVE` button 


## Obtain results

Please see the OWASP Dependency Check documentation for details on scanning applications and 
generating reports. Note that the SSC parser plugin requires the uploaded reports to be in JSON
format.

## Upload results

SSC web interface (manual upload):

* Navigate to the Artifacts tab of your application version
* Click the `UPLOAD` button
* Click the `ADD FILES` button, and select the JSON file to upload
* Enable the `3rd party results` check box
* Select the `OWASP_DEPCHECK` type
  
SSC clients (FortifyClient, Maven plugin, ...):

* Generate a scan.info file containing a single line as follows:  
  `engineType=OWASP_DEPCHECK`
* Generate a zip file containing the following:
	* The scan.info file generated in the previous step
	* The JSON file containing scan results
* Upload the zip file generated in the previous step to SSC
	* Using any SSC client, for example FortifyClient
	* Similar to how you would upload an FPR file



## Developers

The following sections provide information that may be useful for developers of this utility.

### IDE's

This project uses Lombok. In order to have your IDE compile this project without errors, 
you may need to add Lombok support to your IDE. Please see https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview 
for more information.

### Gradle Wrapper

It is strongly recommended to build this project using the included Gradle Wrapper
scripts; using other Gradle versions may result in build errors and other issues.

The Gradle build uses various helper scripts from https://github.com/fortify-ps/gradle-helpers;
please refer to the documentation and comments in included scripts for more information. 

### Common Commands

All commands listed below use Linux/bash notation; adjust accordingly if you
are running on a different platform. All commands are to be executed from
the main project directory.

* `./gradlew tasks --all`: List all available tasks
* Build: (plugin binary will be stored in `build/libs`)
	* `./gradlew clean build`: Clean and build the project
	* `./gradlew build`: Build the project without cleaning
	* `./gradlew dist distThirdParty`: Build distribution zip and third-party information bundle
* `./fortify-scan.sh`: Run a Fortify scan; requires Fortify SCA to be installed

### Automated Builds

This project uses GitHub Actions workflows to perform automated builds for both development and production releases. All pushes to the main branch qualify for building a production release. Commits on the main branch should use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/); it is recommended to also use conventional commit messages on any other branches.

User-facing commits (features or fixes) on the main branch will trigger the [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) to automatically create a pull request for publishing a release version. This pull request contains an automatically generated CHANGELOG.md together with a version.txt based on the conventional commit messages on the main branch. Merging such a pull request will automatically publish the production binaries and Docker images to the locations described in the [Related Links](#related-links) section.

Every push to a branch in the GitHub repository will also automatically trigger a development release to be built. By default, development releases are only published as build job artifacts. However, if a tag named `dev_<branch-name>` exists, then development releases are also published to the locations described in the [Related Links](#related-links) section. The `dev_<branch-name>` tag will be automatically updated to the commit that triggered the build.
