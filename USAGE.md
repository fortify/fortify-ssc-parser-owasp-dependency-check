These sections describe how to install, upgrade and uninstall the parser plugin in SSC.

### Install & Upgrade

     * Download from the repository release page: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-owasp-dependency-check/releases
     * Build the plugin from source: https://github.com/fortify/fortify-ssc-parser-owasp-dependency-check/CONTRIB.md
* If you already have another version of the plugin installed, first uninstall the previously  installed version of the plugin by following the steps under [Uninstall](#uninstall) below
* In Fortify Software Security Center:
	* Navigate to Administration->Plugins->Parsers
	* Click the `NEW` button
	* Accept the warning
	* Upload the plugin jar file

## Obtain results


<!-- START-INCLUDE:parser-obtain-results.md -->

Please see the OWASP Dependency Check documentation for details on scanning applications and generating reports. Note that the SSC parser plugin requires the uploaded reports to be in JSON format.

<!-- END-INCLUDE:parser-obtain-results.md -->


## Upload results

Results can be uploaded through the SSC web interface, REST API, or SSC client utilities like FortifyClient or [fcli](https://github.com/fortify-ps/fcli). The SSC web interface, FortifyClient and most other Fortify clients require the raw results to be packaged into a zip-file; REST API and fcli allow for uploading raw results directly.

To upload results through the SSC web interface or most clients:

* Create a `scan.info` file containing a single line as follows:   
     `engineType=OWASP_DEPCHECK`
* Create a zip file containing the following:
	* The scan.info file generated in the previous step
	* The raw results file as obtained from the target system (see [Obtain results](#obtain-results) section above)
* Upload the zip file generated in the previous step to SSC
	* Using any SSC client, for example FortifyClient or Maven plugin
	* Or using the SSC web interface
	* Similar to how you would upload an FPR file
	
Both SSC REST API and fcli provide options for specifying the engine type directly, and as such it is not necessary to package the raw results into a zip-file with accompanying `scan.info` file. For example, fcli allows for uploading raw scan results using a command like the following:

`fcli ssc appversion-artifact upload <raw-results-file> --appversion MyApp:MyVersion --engine-type OWASP_DEPCHECK`
